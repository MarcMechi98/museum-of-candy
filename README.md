# Museum of Candy Webpage!

 My first webpage using purely HTML and CSS (with bootstrap!)
 The idea of this project belongs to Colt Steele. It is from a Udemy course titled "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022".
 I haven't copied the whole project though. 
 The webpage is fully responsive with css and Bootstrap.
 I tried to go for a simple yet aesthetic feel, with some nice childish pastel colors.
 I've tweaked some things to better suit my tastes and added a simple navbar and footer that look pretty nice and are responsive to the viewport width.
